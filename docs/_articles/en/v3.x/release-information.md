### Release Summary

* NEW (CodeAnalyzer): We made some updates to the RetireJS vulnerability database.

### Release Summary

* NEW (CodeAnalyzer): We updated the PMD engine to version 6.54.0.
* NEW (CodeAnalyzer): We made some updates to the RetireJS vulnerability database.
* FIX (CodeAnalyzer): We updated the reference to the `eslint-recommended` config to point to the updated ESLint dependency. This resolves the error received on new direct or CI/CD installs of Code Analyzer: ```ERROR Cannot find module '/home/runner/.local/share/sfdx/node_modules/eslint/conf/eslint-recommended.js```
* FIX (GraphEngine): We added a new parameter, `--pathexplimit`, on `scanner:run:dfa` to customize Graph Engine's scans of complex codebases. `SFGE_PATH_EXPANSION_LIMIT` is an alternative environment variable to provide the same customization. These options reduce the number of `OutOfMemory` errors produced. For more information, check out our [documentation](en/v3.x/salesforce-graph-engine/working-with-sfge/#understand-outofmemory-errors).

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/forcedotcom/sfdx-scanner/compare/v3.9.0...v3.8.0)

### Release Summary

* NEW (GraphEngine): We added a new graph-based rule, `UnimplementedTypeRule`. This rule identifies abstract classes and interfaces that are non-global and are missing implementations or extensions. See [UnimplementedTypeRule](./en/v3.x/salesforce-graph-engine/rules/#unimplementedtyperule) for more information.
* NEW (CodeAnalyzer): We updated the PMD engine to version 6.53.0.
* NEW (CodeAnalyzer): We made some updates to the RetireJS vulnerability database.
* NEW (GraphEngine): We added sample code to support the unused methods and unused classes and interfaces rules to `sfge-working-app`.
* CHANGE (GraphEngine): We updated the `scanner:rule:describe` and `scanner:rule:list –engine` `sfge` commands to provide info on which Graph Engine rules run with scanner:run:dfa and which rules run with scanner:run.
* FIX (GraphEngine): We optimized heap usage of Graph Engine which decreases the frequency of `OutOfMemory` error.
* FIX (GraphEngine): In Winter '23, Apex added a `WITH USER_MODE` keyword to SOQL queries. Graph Engine recognizes this keyword as secure.
* FIX (CodeAnalyzer): We updated our internal dependencies on `@salesforce/core` and `@salesforce/command`, resulting in minor cosmetic changes to command output.

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/forcedotcom/sfdx-scanner/compare/v3.8.0...v3.7.1)

### Release Summary

* NEW (Code Analyzer): `scanner:run` command executes graph-based rules from Graph Engine. Invoke the new rule by executing `scanner:run` command with `--engine sfge` and providing the `--projectdir` parameter. This behavior is different from path-based rules that are executed with `scanner:run:dfa`.
* NEW (Graph Engine): We added a new graph-based rule, `UnusedMethodRule`. This rule detects methods contained in your code that aren’t invoked. See [UnusedMethodRule](./en/v3.x/salesforce-graph-engine/rules/#UnusedMethodRule) for more information.
* FIX (Graph Engine): `ApexCrudFlsRule` now understands multiple levels of method invocations on Schema Standard Library objects within for-loops.
* FIX (Graph Engine): `ApexCrudFlsRule` now understands for-each iterations on Set data types and acknowledges Schema-based checks within the loops.

* NEW: If a JavaScript target file is analyzed by both `eslint` and `eslint-lwc`, we throw a warning about duplicate violations to alert you that you should modify your configuration.
* NEW: We updated the RetireJS Vulnerability Repository.
* NEW: We upgraded PMD to 6.48.0.
* CHANGE: We replaced eslint's parser with `@babel/eslint-parser`.
* FIX: We removed the survey request banner's stylization.
* FIX \[SFGE\]: When Salesforce Graph Engine (SFGE) is unable to resolve a method call or a variable passed to a database operation, it no longer throws an internal error. Instead, SFGE creates a violation to let you know that you need to verify the CRUD/FLS access of the operation manually.
