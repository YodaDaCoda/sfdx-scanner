## What is Salesforce Graph Engine?
[Salesforce Graph Engine (Graph Engine)](./en/v3.x/salesforce-graph-engine/introduction/) is an open-source Salesforce tool that performs complex analysis on Apex language, and identifies security vulnerabilities and code issues.

Graph Engine is available as an open pilot through Salesforce Code Analyzer (v3.x). [Try it](./en/v3.x/salesforce-graph-engine/try-it-yourself/) and give us your feedback.

## How does Salesforce Code Analyzer use SFGE?
A new command, `scanner run dfa`, has been added to invoke the [data-flow-based](./en/v3.x/salesforce-graph-engine/working-with-sfge/) rules in Graph Engine. Learn more in the [command reference](./en/v3.x/scanner-commands/dfa/).
